# TypeScript Compilation Error: Undeclared Function

This repository demonstrates a common TypeScript error: attempting to use a function before it has been declared.  The `bug.ts` file contains the problematic code. The `bugSolution.ts` file shows how to fix the error by declaring the function before it's used.

This error is caught during compilation, preventing runtime exceptions.  This highlights TypeScript's benefit in early error detection.
